# VikingBlog - Backend

This is me attempting to create the backend for my blog using adonis.js 5.

This is the first time I am using adonis.js framework so I decided to just jump into Adonis 5.

## Installation

Use the package manager [npm](https://www.npmjs.com) to install the backend.

```bash
npm install
```

## Final Notes

Since this is my first commit, I won't have a lot to say here, but I want to make sure that this project is as reusable as possible.

Thank you.
